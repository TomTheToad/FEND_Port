Udacity FEND Portfolio Project

<h3>Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree</h3>
<h2>Project 1: Portfolio</h2>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Modern day browser capable of rendering a grid display.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I haven't had the need to do any serious web development for quite some time.
I figured this would be a fun way to update my skills. This is project number 1. A simple, reactive portfolio site.</p>
